\usage{
load_from_file(user_id, file_name, base_dir)
}
\arguments{
\item{user_id}{A character string representing the user's unique identifier.}

\item{file_name}{The name of the file to load (e.g., `"account_tree.Rds"`,
`"data.json"`).}

\item{base_dir}{The base directory where user data is stored. This should
point to the top-level folder containing all user subdirectories.}
}
\value{
The loaded object, parsed according to the file extension:
\itemize{
  \item `.Rds` files are loaded with \code{readRDS()}
  \item `.json` files are loaded with \code{jsonlite::fromJSON()}
  \item `.csv` files are loaded with \code{read.csv()}

\description{
Loads a user-specific file (e.g., account tree, lock file) from the
localfilesystem.The file format is determined automatically based on its
extension.
}
\details{
This function is intended to be called indirectly through a generic loader
such as \code{\link{load_user_file}}, which determines the appropriate
backend to use. The file extension determines the parser, and unsupported
file types will raise an error.
