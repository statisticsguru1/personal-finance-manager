\title{Remove a User File via Configured Storage Backend}
\usage{
remove_user_file(user_id, file_name = "account_tree.Rds")
}
\arguments{
\item{user_id}{A character string representing the user ID.}

\item{file_name}{Name of the file to remove. Defaults to
`"account_tree.Rds"`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `NULL`. Issues a warning if the file does not
  exist, or throws an error if the backend plugin is not found.
}
\description{
Deletes a specific user file using the appropriate backend plugin, based
on the `ACCOUNT_BACKEND` environment variable. This function abstracts the
file removal logic, allowing different storage systems to handle file
deletion (e.g., local file system, MongoDB, Google Drive).
}
\details{
The actual removal behavior is implemented by the selected
  backend plugin (e.g., `remove_from_file`, `remove_from_gdrive`, etc.).
  Configuration is controlled via environment variables like
  `ACCOUNT_BACKEND` and `ACCOUNT_BASE_DIR`.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  remove_user_file("user123")  # Deletes "account_tree.Rds"
  remove_user_file("user123", file_name = "data.json")
}
