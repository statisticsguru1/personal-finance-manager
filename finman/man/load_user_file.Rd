\title{Load a User's File from the Storage Backend}
\usage{
load_user_file(user_id, file_name = "account_tree.Rds")
}
\arguments{
\item{user_id}{A string representing the unique user ID.}

\item{file_name}{The name of the file to load (e.g., `"account_tree.Rds"`).
This should be a base name relative to the user-specific storage root.}
}
\value{
The R object loaded from the specified file.
}
\description{
Loads a file associated with a user from the configured storage backend.
The backend is determined by the `ACCOUNT_BACKEND` environment variable
(default is `"file"` for local storage), and supports loading various file
types like `.Rds`, `.json`, and `.csv` via the appropriate plugin.
}
\details{
This function provides a unified interface to load user-specific data,
regardless of where or how it is stored (e.g., local file system, cloud,
or database). The actual loading logic is delegated to a plugin based
on the backend, which is configured using environment variables.


The function constructs the appropriate arguments for the selected
backend using `build_plugin_args()` and dispatches the call using
`do.call()`. The file type determines how the file is parsed (e.g.,
`.Rds` via `readRDS()`, `.json` via `jsonlite::fromJSON()`).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
Sys.setenv(ACCOUNT_BACKEND = "file")
load_user_file("user123", "account_tree.Rds")
load_user_file("user123", "transactions.csv")
}
