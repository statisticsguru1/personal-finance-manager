# 📦 What is `finman`?

The `finman` package powers the logic of the Finance Manager system. It defines core account types (Main, Child, Grandchild), allocation rules, transaction tracking, and file-based persistence.

# 🧠 Key Concepts

**Account Hierarchy**

- `MainAccount`: Receives income and distributes it.
- `ChildAccount`: Receives allocations and may hold rules.
- `GrandchildAccount`: Tracks obligations (e.g., rent, school fees).

**Account Behavior**

- Accounts deactivate when fully funded.
- They reactivate based on periodic due dates.
- Loan accounts can pull funds automatically from the main account.

**Persistence**

- Accounts and their states are stored with `save_user_file()` and loaded using `load_user_file()`.

# 🚀 Creating an Account Tree

```{r create_tree}
main <- MainAccount$new("Main")
needs <- ChildAccount$new("Needs", allocation = 0.5)
savings <- ChildAccount$new("Savings", allocation = 0.3)
debt <- ChildAccount$new("Debt", allocation = 0.2)

main$add_child_account(needs)
main$add_child_account(savings)
main$add_child_account(debt)

rent <- GrandchildAccount$new(
  "Rent", freq = 30, due_date = today() + 5, fixed_amount = 5000
)
needs$add_child_account(rent)
```

# 💸 Allocation and Transactions

Accounts can be allocated funds in several ways:

- **Percentage Allocation**  
  Child and grandchild accounts receive money from their parent based on predefined percentages. Depositing into a parent triggers automatic distribution. Parent balances remain zero unless children are fully funded.

- **Direct Deposits**  
  Depositing directly into a lower-level account is treated as allocation to that account.

- **Refunds**  
  If a child account receives more than it needs, the extra amount is refunded to the parent. The parent redistributes this unless all child accounts are inactive.

**Example:**

```{r allocate_money}
# Deposit income (in other words allocate money to main account)
main$deposit(20000, channel = "ABSA")
```

# 📊 Viewing Allocation Results

This is how money trickled down.

```{r allocation_results}
# balance
main$get_balance()              # balance in main account
needs$get_balance()             # balance in needs account
savings$get_balance()           # balance in savings account
debt$get_balance()              # balance in debt account
rent$get_balance()              # balance in rent account

# Total balance
main$compute_total_balance()    # total balance in main account+its children
                                # this is literary the accumulated money in your
                                # bank account

needs$compute_total_balance()   # total balance in needs account+ its children
                                # what amount in your bank account is there to 
                                # cover needs

savings$compute_total_balance()   # total balance in savings account+ its children
                                  # what amount in your bank account is there to 
                                  # cover savings

debt$compute_total_balance()   # total balance in debt account+ its children
                                  # what amount in your bank account is there to 
                                  # cover debt

rent$compute_total_balance()   # total balance in rent(it has no children)
                               # what amount in your bank account is there to 
                               # cover rent (a sinking fund)
                            

# amount due 
main$compute_total_due()        # Total amount of debt(current+longterm)

needs$compute_total_due()       # Total amount of debt from needs (current+longterm)

savings$compute_total_due()     # Total amount of debt from savings (current+longterm)
                                # thes are unmet fixed savings etc.

rent$compute_total_due()     # Total amount of debt from rent (current+longterm)
                             # this is what you need to pay from the sinking fund
                             # for rent
```


### ❓ Why is Rent’s balance zero?

```{r rent details}
rent$status
```

**Answer:** The `Rent` account is inactive.

When it was created, we didn't assign it an allocation percentage, so it defaulted to zero. Accounts with zero allocation are considered inactive — this tells the system not to fund them.

Let’s fix that:

```{r activate_rent}
needs$set_child_allocation("Rent", 0.5)
rent$change_status("active")
```

# 💸 Direct Deposits to Grandchild Accounts

You can also allocate funds by depositing directly into a grandchild account.

```{r allocate_to_low_level}
rent$deposit(20000, channel = "Barclays")
```

Since Rent is now fully funded, it becomes inactive and stops drawing from `Needs`. If there were other active siblings, they would receive future allocations. Over time, this behavior self-corrects over- or under-funding.

```{r see_status}
rent$get_account_status()
```

```{r see stats}
# balance
rent$get_balance()    # get rent balance
needs$get_balance()   # needs(parent) balance has increased by the refund amount

# overall balance
needs$compute_total_balance()  # need account has more money
needs$compute_total_due()  # need total due has decreased
main$compute_total_due()   # even on the whole tree there is decrease
                           # you have reduced total payable.  
```

# 📊 Advanced Metrics

**Spending** tracks actual payments (withdrawals).  
**Allocated Amount** is the total amount directed to an account and its descendants.  
**Income Utilization** shows how much of that allocation has been spent.

If utilization is 0%, it means you’ve saved for obligations but haven’t actually spent the money.

```{r advanced_stats}
main$allocated_amount() # total income allocated
main$spending()         # total spend
main$income_utilization() # utilization of allocated amount?

needs$allocated_amount() # total income allocated to needs
needs$spending()         # how much of the allocation is spend
needs$income_utilization() # utilization level


savings$allocated_amount() # total income allocated to savings
savings$spending()         # how much of the allocation is spend
savings$income_utilization() # utilization level

debt$allocated_amount() # total income allocated to debt
debt$spending()         # how much of the allocation is spend
debt$income_utilization() # utilization level
```

# 🧾 Spending Some Amount

Let’s simulate spending:

```{r spend_some_amount}
rent$withdraw(5000,channel="ABSA")      # paid rent
savings$withdraw(6000,channel="ABSA")   # withdraw to pay savings the specifics
                                        # Not known we can specify this by attaching
                                        # which are the specific savings
debt$withdraw(4000,channel="ABSA")      # withdraw to pay savings the specifics
```

# 📉 After Spending: Utilization Analysis

```{r evolution}
main$allocated_amount() # total income allocated
main$spending()         # total spend
main$income_utilization() # utilization of allocated amount?

needs$allocated_amount() # total income allocated to needs
needs$spending()         # how much of the allocation is spend
needs$income_utilization() # utilization level


savings$allocated_amount() # total income allocated to savings
savings$spending()         # how much of the allocation is spend
savings$income_utilization() # utilization level

debt$allocated_amount() # total income allocated to debt
debt$spending()         # how much of the allocation is spend
debt$income_utilization() # utilization level
```

> Example interpretation:  
> A 37.5% utilization rate means only 37.5% of allocated funds were actually used. The rest remains idle.  
> In `Needs`, only `Rent` was defined — hence low utilization. You may want to define more obligations to reflect your actual needs.

# 🔄 Advanced Usage

- Set obligation frequency: `set_account_freq()`
- Define fixed obligations: `set_fixed_amount()`
- Configure time periods: `set_account_periods()`
- Use `with_account_lock()` for concurrency-safe operations
