## 📊 Income Allocation Strategies

This vignette demonstrates how `finman` lets you build customized budgeting trees using real-world strategies — from **50/30/20**, to handling high debt or low income. The system supports:

- Tiered budgeting (e.g., Needs → Rent, Food).
- Flexible allocation percentages.
- Passive vs. greedy allocation flows.

---

## 📁 Strategy 1: Standard 50/30/20 Budget

This strategy breaks income into:

- **50% Needs** – Rent, Food, Utilities.
- **30% Savings/Wants** – Emergency Fund, Hobbies.
- **20% Debt** – Loan payments, Credit cards.

```{r}
main <- MainAccount$new("Main")

needs <- ChildAccount$new("Needs", allocation = 0.5)
savings <- ChildAccount$new("Savings", allocation = 0.3)
debt <- ChildAccount$new("Debt", allocation = 0.2)

main$add_child_account(needs)
main$add_child_account(savings)
main$add_child_account(debt)

# Tier 3 accounts under Needs
needs$add_child_account(GrandchildAccount$new("Rent", fixed_amount = 8000, freq = 30, due_date = Sys.Date() + 7))
needs$add_child_account(GrandchildAccount$new("Food", fixed_amount = 3000, freq = 30, due_date = Sys.Date() + 7))

# Under Savings
savings$add_child_account(GrandchildAccount$new("Emergency Fund", fixed_amount = 5000, freq = 30, due_date = Sys.Date() + 7))

# Under Debt
debt$add_child_account(GrandchildAccount$new("Student Loan", fixed_amount = 6000, freq = 30, due_date = Sys.Date() + 7))

# Fund the budget
main$deposit(30000, channel = "ABSA")
```

---

## ⚠️ Strategy 2: Debt-Heavy Budget

Users with overwhelming debt might prioritize repayment:

- Allocate **40–60% to Debt**.
- Reduce Wants or Savings.
- Pay off defaulted or overdue loans first.

```{r}
main <- MainAccount$new("Main")

debt_recovery <- ChildAccount$new("Debt Recovery", allocation = 0.5)
needs <- ChildAccount$new("Needs", allocation = 0.4)
savings <- ChildAccount$new("Savings", allocation = 0.1)

main$add_child_account(debt_recovery)
main$add_child_account(needs)
main$add_child_account(savings)

debt_recovery$add_child_account(GrandchildAccount$new("Defaulted Loan", fixed_amount = 15000, freq = 30, due_date = Sys.Date()))
debt_recovery$add_child_account(GrandchildAccount$new("Overdue Credit", fixed_amount = 12000, freq = 30, due_date = Sys.Date()))
```

---

## 💼 Strategy 3: High-Income, Low-Need

With more disposable income:

- Reduce Needs to 30%.
- Boost long-term savings or projects.
- Automatically fund goals like Retirement or Land.

```{r}
main <- MainAccount$new("Main")

main$add_child_account(ChildAccount$new("Needs", allocation = 0.3))
main$add_child_account(ChildAccount$new("Savings", allocation = 0.5))
main$add_child_account(ChildAccount$new("Wants", allocation = 0.2))

# Add savings targets
main$child_accounts$Savings$add_child_account(GrandchildAccount$new("Retirement", fixed_amount = 8000, freq = 30, due_date = Sys.Date() + 30))
main$child_accounts$Savings$add_child_account(GrandchildAccount$new("Land Purchase", fixed_amount = 10000, freq = 60, due_date = Sys.Date() + 60))
```

---

## 📉 Strategy 4: Low Income, High Obligation

- Focus all allocation on critical expenses.
- Postpone savings and wants.
- Let optional accounts deactivate automatically.

```{r}
main <- MainAccount$new("Main")

needs <- ChildAccount$new("Needs", allocation = 0.9)
savings <- ChildAccount$new("Savings", allocation = 0.1)
wants <- ChildAccount$new("Wants", allocation = 0.0)

main$add_child_account(needs)
main$add_child_account(savings)
main$add_child_account(wants)

needs$add_child_account(GrandchildAccount$new("Rent", fixed_amount = 7000, freq = 30, due_date = Sys.Date() + 5))
needs$add_child_account(GrandchildAccount$new("Food", fixed_amount = 3000, freq = 30, due_date = Sys.Date() + 5))
```
